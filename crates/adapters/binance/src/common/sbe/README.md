# Binance SBE Codecs

- `spot/` contains Rust code generated by Real Logic's Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) generator from the Binance Spot API SBE schema (schema 3:1). Do not edit these files manually; regenerate with the Real Logic SBE tool when the schema changes.
- `stream/` contains hand-written decoders for Binance market data stream messages (schema 1:0).

Licensing

- The `spot/` codecs are generated using the Apache-2.0 licensed Real Logic SBE tool; see `../../../licenses/Apache-2.0-RealLogic-SBE.txt` and the entry in `../../../licenses/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
- The hand-written `stream/` code is covered by the NautilusTrader project license.

Modifications

The generated `spot/` code has been modified from the original SBE generator output:

- Added module-level lint suppression attributes in `mod.rs` for clippy compatibility
- Reordered `pub use` statements to appear before `use super::*` (fixes rustfmt)
- Removed unused codec modules (institutional, order amendments, user data stream mgmt)

Regeneration

When regenerating from a new schema, reapply these modifications:

1. Run Real Logic SBE generator with the Binance schema
2. Add lint attributes to `spot/mod.rs` (see existing file)
3. Fix `pub use` ordering in each codec file
4. Remove unused modules and update `mod.rs` accordingly
